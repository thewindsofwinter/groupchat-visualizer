# Group Chat Visualizer

This repository stores some explorations I'm doing out of curiosity in the summer.
Specifically, I seek to utilize stored Messenger data to quantify interesting things
about social dynamics in any specific group-chat. For now, there are a couple statistics
I seek to visualize (likely put into a "report" style PDF after running).

 - [X] First message, last message, number of messages
 - [X] Number of messages sent by any specific person
 - [-] Reaction "graph" between people: who reacts to who
    - [ ] Normalized by the total number of reactions a person gives out
    - [ ] Normalized by the total number of reactions a person receives
    - [X] Unnormalized
 - [ ] Mentions of a person's name within messages
 - [ ] Graph of replies to messages by any given person
 - [ ] Line graph of activity and statistics about activity by weekday or season
 - [ ] Information on message length
    - [ ] Versus time
    - [ ] By person

This started because I wanted to analyze the interactions between my friends during
the coronavirus pandemic. I plan on putting all my things into a website (that might
be hosted with GitHub Pages) once I've completed this to-do list. Suggestions are welcome!

# Group Chat Visualizer

This repository stores some explorations I'm doing out of curiosity in the summer.
Specifically, I seek to utilize stored Messenger data to quantify interesting things
about social dynamics in any specific group-chat. For now, there are a couple statistics
I seek to visualize (likely put into a "report" style PDF after running).

 - First message, last message, number of messages
 - Number of messages sent by any specific person
 - Reaction "graph" between people: who reacts to who
    - Normalized by the total number of reactions a person gives out
    - Normalized by the total number of reactions a person receives
    - Unnormalized
 - Mentions of a person's name within messages
 - Graph of replies to messages by any given person
 - Line graph of activity and statistics about activity by weekday or season

This started because I wanted to analyze the interactions between my friends during
the coronavirus pandemic. I plan on putting all my things into a website (that might
be hosted with GitHub Pages) once I've completed this to-do list. Suggestions are welcome!
